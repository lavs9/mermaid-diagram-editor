# MVP Requirements for Mermaid.js Integration

## Core Features

1. **Bidirectional Code-to-Visual and Visual-to-Code Support**
   - Users can write Mermaid.js syntax to generate visual diagrams.
   - Users can edit diagrams visually, and the corresponding code updates dynamically.
   - Rendering is triggered manually (e.g., "Run" button) to optimize performance.

2. **Image Export**
   - Allow exporting diagrams as:
     - PNG
     - SVG
     - PDF (optional, for future enhancement)
   - Include a "Copy as Embed Code" feature for web integrations.

3. **Supported Chart Types**
   - Initial support for the following five Mermaid.js chart types:
     1. Flowcharts
     2. Sequence Diagrams
     3. Gantt Charts
     4. Pie Charts
     5. Class Diagrams
   - Gradual expansion to other chart types as feedback is collected.

4. **Enhanced Visual Editor**
   - Support embedding emojis and supported images within diagrams.
   - Future potential: Drag-and-drop functionality for node arrangement.

5. **Live Syntax Validation**
   - Display real-time errors or warnings for invalid Mermaid syntax.

6. **Themes and Styles**
   - Pre-configured themes (e.g., dark, light, custom color palettes).
   - Basic styling options: font size, node colors, arrow styles.

7. **Templates and Presets**
   - Include pre-built templates for supported chart types.
   - Allow users to load, modify, and export these templates.

8. **Interactive Preview**
   - Responsive preview to test how diagrams adapt to various resolutions.

## Recommended Additional Features for MVP

1. **Version History**
   - Enable users to undo changes or revert to previous diagram versions.

2. **Shareable Links**
   - Generate sharable URLs for diagrams.
   - Optional settings for public/private sharing.

3. **Custom Fonts and Branding**
   - Allow users to use custom fonts or add logos (important for organizations).

4. **Accessibility Features**
   - Keyboard navigation and screen-reader-friendly descriptions.

5. **Localization Support**
   - Support for multiple languages to cater to a global audience.

6. **Documentation and Tutorials**
    - Integrate guided tours or pop-ups for feature explanations.
    - Provide links to Mermaid.js documentation for advanced users.

## Technical Considerations

1. **Frontend**:
   - Use libraries like CodeMirror or Monaco Editor for syntax highlighting.
   - Integrate the official Mermaid.js library for rendering and error handling.

2. **Backend**:
   - Optional for initial MVP; client-side-only implementation can handle exports.
   - Add backend support for secure export handling if needed.

3. **Analytics**:
   - Track which chart types and features are most used to inform future updates.

### Next Steps
- Prioritize core features for initial implementation.
- Gather user feedback to determine the next set of features to roll out.
