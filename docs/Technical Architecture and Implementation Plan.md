## **1. Overview**
This document outlines the technical architecture and implementation plan for the Mermaid.js and JSON canvas-based diagramming platform. The platform will support Mermaid syntax editing, live diagram rendering, and other interactive features for diagram creation and export.

### **Core Technologies**
- **Frontend**: React with Shadcnui components
- **Editor**: CodeMirror for syntax highlighting
- **Diagram Rendering**: Official Mermaid.js library

---

## **2. Architecture**

### **Frontend Architecture**
1. **React Framework**
   - Modular, component-based architecture for scalability.
   - State management with Context API or Zustand (for lightweight and scalable state).

2. **UI Components**
   - Use Shadcnui components to build a consistent, modern, and accessible UI.
   - Component examples:
     - Sidebar navigation for chart selection and settings.
     - Main editor pane with CodeMirror and rendering preview.
     - Toolbar for export and theme selection.

3. **CodeMirror Integration**
   - Features:
     - Mermaid.js syntax highlighting.
     - Autocomplete for frequently used Mermaid elements (e.g., nodes, arrows).
     - Error messages displayed in-line for live syntax validation.

4. **Rendering with Mermaid.js**
   - Use the official Mermaid.js library for diagram rendering.
   - Trigger rendering on demand (e.g., "Run" button) for performance optimization.

5. **Image Export**
   - Integrate with the Mermaid.js export API for generating PNG/SVG images.
   - Include options for "Copy Embed Code" and download.

### **Backend Architecture** (Optional for MVP)
- Initially, aim for a client-side-only implementation.
- For future scalability:
  1. **Language**: Node.js for backend services.
  2. **APIs**: REST or GraphQL for:
     - User authentication (optional for MVP).
     - Diagram saving and sharing.
     - Export handling for larger diagrams.

3. **Database**:
   - NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) for storing diagram data and user preferences.
   - Alternatives: LocalStorage or IndexedDB for client-only implementation.

---

## **3. Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Core Feature Development**
1. **Setup Project Environment**
   - Initialize a React project with TypeScript.
   - Install Shadcnui, CodeMirror, and Mermaid.js libraries.

2. **Build UI Layout**
   - Create a sidebar for chart type selection.
   - Add a CodeMirror-based editor panel.
   - Implement a preview area using Mermaid.js.

3. **Mermaid.js Integration**
   - Integrate Mermaid.js for rendering diagrams.
   - Set up syntax validation and error display.
   - Enable live rendering on "Run" button click.

4. **Export Features**
   - Add options to export diagrams as PNG and SVG.
   - Implement "Copy Embed Code" functionality.

5. **Themes and Styles**
   - Configure pre-defined themes (dark, light, custom colors).

---

### **Phase 2: Advanced Features**
1. **Templates and Presets**
   - Build pre-configured templates for supported chart types.
   - Add a "Load Template" feature in the UI.

2. **Interactive Features**
   - Emoji and image support in diagrams (via Mermaid.js).
   - Localization support for multilingual users.

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Version history for diagrams.
   - Keyboard shortcuts for faster editing.

4. **Analytics (Optional)**
   - Track chart type usage and feature adoption to guide future updates.

---

### **Phase 3: Deployment**
1. **Self-hosted Version**
   - Package the application for Docker to simplify deployment.

2. **Cloud Version**
   - Deploy to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Vercel, or Netlify).
   - Add tier-based features for premium users.

---

## **4. Key Libraries and Tools**
- **Shadcnui**: For responsive and customizable UI components.
- **CodeMirror**: For a robust and feature-rich code editor.
- **Mermaid.js**: For seamless diagram rendering and export.
- **React**: For building a scalable and performant frontend.
- **Optional Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: Backend services.
  - **MongoDB**: Data storage for diagrams and user preferences.

---

### Next Steps
1. Set up the project repository and install core dependencies.
2. Build the basic layout and integrate the CodeMirror editor.
3. Test Mermaid.js rendering and export functionality.
4. Expand features iteratively based on the implementation plan.
